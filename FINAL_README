Controls work as follows: WASD changes the angle of view, UP and DOWN moves forwards and backwards.

Features: GPU raytracing is the notable technical feature of the project. It works much like raytracing in the ray
and intersect assignments. The motion of the planets and accepting user input is the only significant computation
on the CPU. The motion of the planets is realistic, in the sense the angular velocity of each planet is the same as
according to the inverse squared law of gravitation (though such speeds would only be possible for a very massive
object.)
